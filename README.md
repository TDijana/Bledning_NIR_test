# Blending_NIR_test
Blend Uniformity Determination by NIR

Background
Purpose 
•	In-line determination of powder blend homogeneity during the blending process using NIR spectroscopy as PAT tool
•	Blending process monitoring and understanding by collecting NIR data over the whole blending process (including blending endpoint determination)

Method
•	For the use of the NIR spectrometer to determine the blend uniformity, the qualitative approach (trend analysis or rate of change procedure) is used: 
the “moving block standard deviation” (MBSD) and the “moving block F test” 
•	Tools: A Near Infrared (NIR) spectrometer (SentroPAT BU II, Sentronic GmbH) is used to collect spectral data during the blending process and to assess blend uniformity.

Possibilities & Limitations
•	Possibilities: 
o	In-line/Real-time and non-invasive method
o	Increased process understanding
o	Safe handling & Ressource Savings
•	Limitations: 
o	Formulation-related Limitations: 
	No characteristic API band in the overall spectrum of all blending components
	Very high (e.g., 99%) or very low (e.g., 1%) API concentrations
o	Process-related Limitations:
	Batch size<5L 
	Blender type not suitable (e.g. Turbula Blender)



Input/ Procedure
Input: Requirements before measurement
•	Formulation Details
o	Composition (qualitative and quantitative)
o	Batch Size (in kg)
•	Process information
o	Blender Type (e.g. bin blender)
o	Blending Process (duration, blending steps, etc)
•	Measurement information:
o	Scheduled day and time (note: at least 1 week ahead!)
Procedure
In order to request BU by NIR support, the request form (see XXX) has to be filled out. All mandatory requirements are questioned within this form and further information are provided.

Note: Time required for set-up and preparation of NIR measurement: at least 1 week before scheduled day of blending

Output/Results
•	Blend Uniformity Report including among other information:
o	Formulation Details
o	Blending Process Details
o	NIR Method details
o	Results:
	Graph of MBSD/ MB FTest over time
	Clear statement if blend homogeneity was achieved or not
o	Risk mitigation: no occurance of window fouling 
•	Report will be uploaded to attache 
•	Document numbers of report will be added to request

		<h1> Background </h1>
	
		<h2> Purpose </h2>
		**In-line determination of powder blend homogeneity** during the blending process using NIR spectroscopy as PAT tool
		** Blending process monitoring and understanding** by collecting NIR data over the whole blending 					process (including blending endpoint determination)

		<h2> Method </h2>
		> 1. For the use of the NIR spectrometer to determine the blend uniformity, the **qualitative approach**			(trend analysis or rate of change procedure) is used: the “moving block standard deviation” (MBSD) and the “moving block F test” 
		> 2. **Tools:** A Near Infrared (NIR) spectrometer (SentroPAT BU II, Sentronic GmbH) is used to collect spectral data during the blending process and to assess blend uniformity. 

		<h2> Possibilities & Limitations </h2>

			> 1. Possibilities: 
				1. In-line/Real-time and non-invasive method
				2. Increased process understanding	
				3. Safe handling & Ressource Savings

			1. Limitations: 

					* Formulation-related Limitations: 
						* No characteristic API band in the overall spectrum of all blending components
						* Very high (e.g., 99%) or very low (e.g., 1%) API concentrations
					* Process-related Limitations:
						* Batch size<5L 
						* Blender type not suitable (e.g. Turbula Blender)

		### Input/ Procedure

		# **Input: Requirements before measurement**

			* Formulation Details

		# **Procedure**

		<p> In order to request BU by NIR support, the request form (see XXX) has to be filled out. All mandatory requirements are questioned within this form and further information are provided. </p>

		_Note: Time required for set-up and preparation of NIR measurement: at least **1 week** before scheduled day of blending_

		<h2> *Output/Results* </h2>

		1. o	•	Blend Uniformity Report including among other information:
						* Formulation Details
						* Blending Process Details
						* NIR Method Details
						* Results:
								- Graph of MBSD/ MB FTest over time
								- Clear statement if blend homogeneity was achieved or not

						* Risk mitigation: no occurance of window fouling 
						* Report will be uploaded to attache 
						* *Document numbers of report will be added to request*

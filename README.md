# Blending Uniformity Determination using NIR spectrocopy
---
## Background

### Purpose 
- **In-line determination of powder blend homogeneity** during the blending process using NIR spectroscopy as PAT tool
- **Blending process monitoring and understanding** by collecting NIR data over the whole blending process (including blending endpoint determination)

### Method
- For the use of the NIR spectrometer to determine the blend uniformity, the **qualitative approach**  (trend analysis or rate of change procedure) is used: the “moving block standard deviation” (MBSD) and the “moving block F test”
- **Tools**: A Near Infrared (NIR) spectrometer (SentroPAT BU II, Sentronic GmbH) is used to collect spectral data during the blending process and to assess blend uniformity

### Possibilities & Limitations 

1. Possibilities:
	- In-line/Real-time and non-invasive method 
	- Increased process understanding
	- Safe handling & Ressource Savings

2. Limitations:

	2.1. Formulation-related Limitations:
	- No characteristic API band in the overall spectrum of all blending components 
	- Very high (e.g., 99%) or very low (e.g., 1%) API concentrations 

	2.2. Process-related Limitations: 
	- Batch size<5L 
	- Blender type not suitable (e.g. Turbula Blender) 

## Input/ Procedure 
### Input: Requirements before measurement
**Formulation Detail**
1. Composition (qualitative and quantitative)
	- Batch Size (in kg)
	- Process information
2. Blender Type (e.g. bin blender)
3. Blending Process (duration, blending steps, etc)
4. Measurement information:
	- Scheduled day and time (note: at least 1 week ahead!)

## Procedure
In order to request BU by NIR support, the request form (see [Request Form Title] (https://attache.abbvienet.com/hpi/search) has to be filled out. All mandatory requirements are questioned within this form and further information are provided. 
___
*Note: Time required for set-up and preparation of NIR measurement: at least **1 week** before scheduled day of blending*

## Output/Results 
**Blend Uniformity Report including among other information:**
1. Formulation Details 
2. Blending Process Details
3. NIR Method Details

**Results:**
- Graph of MBSD/ MB FTest over time 
- Clear statement if blend homogeneity was achieved or not 
- Risk mitigation: no occurance of window fouling 
- Report will be uploaded to attache
- *Document numbers of report will be added to request*

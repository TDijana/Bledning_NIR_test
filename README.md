		## Background
		### Purpose
			* <span style="color:black">some * In-line determination of powder blend homogeneity * text</span>
			during the blending process using NIR spectroscopy as PAT tool
			* <span style="color:black">some * Blending process monitoring and understanding * text</span>
			by collecting NIR data over the whole blending process (including blending endpoint determination)

		## Method
			* •	For the use of the NIR spectrometer to determine the blend uniformity, the <span style="color:black"> qualitative approach* text</span> (trend analysis or rate of change procedure) is used: 
				the “moving block standard deviation” (MBSD) and the “moving block F test” 

			* <span style="color:black">some * Tools: * text</span> A Near Infrared (NIR) spectrometer (SentroPAT BU II, Sentronic GmbH) is used to collect spectral data during the blending process and to assess blend uniformity.

		## Possibilities & Limitations

			* Possibilities: 
					 * In-line/Real-time and non-invasive method
					 * Increased process understanding
					 * Safe handling & Ressource Savings

			* Limitations: 

					* Formulation-related Limitations: 
						* No characteristic API band in the overall spectrum of all blending components
						* Very high (e.g., 99%) or very low (e.g., 1%) API concentrations
					* Process-related Limitations:
						* Batch size<5L 
						* Blender type not suitable (e.g. Turbula Blender)

		### Input/ Procedure

		# **Input: Requirements before measurement**

			* Formulation Details

		# **Procedure**

		<p> In order to request BU by NIR support, the request form (see XXX) has to be filled out. All mandatory requirements are questioned within this form and further information are provided. </p>

		* Note: Time required for set-up and preparation of NIR measurement: at least **1 week** before scheduled day of blending *

		### Output/Results 

		1. o	•	Blend Uniformity Report including among other information:
						* Formulation Details
						* Blending Process Details
						* NIR Method Details
						* Results:
								- Graph of MBSD/ MB FTest over time
								- Clear statement if blend homogeneity was achieved or not

						* Risk mitigation: no occurance of window fouling 
						* Report will be uploaded to attache 
						* *Document numbers of report will be added to request*

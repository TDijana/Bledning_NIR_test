		<h1> Background </h1>
		
		## Purpose
		
			** In-line determination of powder blend homogeneity ** during the blending process using NIR spectroscopy as 					PAT tool
			** Blending process monitoring and understanding** by collecting NIR data over the whole blending process 					(including blending endpoint determination)
			
		## Method
			1. For the use of the NIR spectrometer to determine the blend uniformity, qualitative approach (trend analysis 					or rate of change procedure) is used: the “moving block standard deviation” (MBSD) and the “moving block 					F test” 

			2. Tools: A Near Infrared (NIR) spectrometer (SentroPAT BU II, Sentronic GmbH) is used to collect spectral data 				during the blending process and to assess blend uniformity.

		## Possibilities & Limitations

			* Possibilities: 
					 * In-line/Real-time and non-invasive method
					 * Increased process understanding
					 * Safe handling & Ressource Savings

			* Limitations: 

					* Formulation-related Limitations: 
						* No characteristic API band in the overall spectrum of all blending components
						* Very high (e.g., 99%) or very low (e.g., 1%) API concentrations
					* Process-related Limitations:
						* Batch size<5L 
						* Blender type not suitable (e.g. Turbula Blender)
